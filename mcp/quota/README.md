# quota

An MCP server with one tool, `get-quota`, that tells Claude how much of the plan's quota is left and
how fast it is being spent, so that it can decide what work to start. It reports the five-hour and
seven-day plan windows and any per-model weekly windows, each with the percentage used, the reset
time, and the rate of use over the last 2, 10 and 20 minutes. A forecast lists every window with the
minutes until it runs out if the last 2 minutes' rate continues, beside the minutes until it resets.
The longer spans show whether that rate is a burst or steady. A companion hook, `notice.py`, tells
the model when a window passes 90%, 95% or 99%, without waiting for it to call the tool.

The data is what the status line shows. The server fetches nothing: it reads what
`statusline/statusline.py` records on every render, as described in `statusline/RECORDING.md`.
When a recording has stopped being updated, the tool returns an error instead of a number, because
a value that no longer moves reads as quota not being spent.

## What it returns

An answer for an account under heavy load, abridged:

- `in_minutes` is `null` when the 2-minute rate is zero or not measured yet.
- Rates are percentage points per minute, every span ending now. Percentages are whole numbers,
  so the 2-minute rate moves in steps of half a point a minute.
- `measured_minutes` appears only for a span that reaches back past the start of the window or of
  the recording.
- `guidance` appears on a window that runs out before it resets at the 2-minute rate, and says what
  to do: start only work that will finish, or for a weekly window, ask the user before large work.
  When the 10-minute rate would last until the reset, it says the 2-minute rate is a burst instead.
- `context` is the calling conversation's own. For a subagent it is read from the subagent's
  transcript and has no window size, which the transcript does not record. It is left out when it
  cannot be read.
- The answer is MCP structured content, with an `outputSchema` describing every field.

When it cannot vouch for the data, the tool returns an error that says why and what to do: nothing
is recording, the recording has gone stale or does not match its schema, no quota data has arrived
since the session started or since `/login`, or the data is still the previous login's. Per-model
data older than five minutes is left out with a note, as the status line shows `STL` for it.

## How the model is told to use it

The server's instructions, which Claude Code shows the model at session start, say to call
`get-quota` before large or parallel work and when asked about quota. They tell the model never to
slow down for quota, since reaching a limit only pauses work until the reset and quota left unused
at a reset is lost. Near a limit, it should start only work that will finish before it, and it
should ask first if the seven-day window would run out. Quota used by other sessions or other
machines is normal, and the model is told not to investigate it. A subagent that stops early
because of quota is told to say so in its final report. A running session picks up changed
instructions when its server reconnects.

## Notices

The model calls `get-quota` before starting work, not while the work runs. `notice.py`, a
`PostToolUse` and `UserPromptSubmit` hook, checks the recording on every tool call and prompt, and
when a window passes 90%, 95% or 99% it adds a note to the model's context: a line naming the window
and the threshold, followed by `get-quota`'s answer.

Each conversation is told once per threshold per window. The main conversation and every subagent
are told separately, since each acts on its own work. A subagent can be reached only this way:
while a foreground subagent runs, the main conversation makes no tool calls. A window that resets
starts over. The check takes a few tens of milliseconds and runs the server only on a crossing.

## Requirements

- A recorder: normally `statusline.py` running as the status line command, either drawing the
  line or with `--record-only` to keep Claude Code's own footer. See the status line section of
  the top-level README, and "Other recorders" below.
- `uv`, which runs `server.py` with its one dependency, the MCP Python SDK.
- The `PreToolUse` hook in `hook.py`, which passes the calling session's ID to the tool.
- Optionally, the `notice.py` hook for notices.

## Installation

Register the server under the name `quota`, since the hook's matcher below depends on it:

```
claude mcp add --scope user quota -- uv run --script "$PWD/mcp/quota/server.py"
```

Add the hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json`, with the path to your checkout. The second and third
entries are the notices:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "mcp__quota__get-quota",
        "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "python /path/to/mcp/quota/hook.py" }]
      }
    ],
    "PostToolUse": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "python /path/to/mcp/quota/notice.py" }] }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "python /path/to/mcp/quota/notice.py" }] }
    ]
  }
}
```

Setting `statusLine.refreshInterval` is recommended. The status line is otherwise drawn only when
something in the session changes, and a call made while it has not been drawn for a minute, such
as one from a long-running subagent, is refused as stale.

## Other recorders

The server reads the files defined by the JSON Schemas in `schemas/`, from the directory named by
`CLAUDE_QUOTA_STATE`, or `~/.local/state/claude-quota` by default. Any tool that writes them can
stand in for `statusline.py`. The server validates what it reads, and when a file does not match,
returns an error naming the schema. `uv run --script server.py --write-schemas` regenerates the
schemas from the models in `server.py`.

## Tests

From the repository root:

```
uv run --with pytest --with "mcp>=2.2,<3" --with jsonschema pytest mcp/quota/tests
```

They include a contract test that runs `statusline.py` to write a recording, checks it against the
schemas, and reads it back through the server.

## Why the hook

The tool publishes no parameters, yet the server has to know which session is asking so that it
can read that session's recording. The `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` the server inherits is fixed when
Claude Code starts it, and goes stale on `/clear` or an in-session `/resume`, while the server keeps
running. No MCP request carries the current ID either.

A `PreToolUse` hook's input always carries the current `session_id`, and the `updatedInput` it
returns is merged into the call's arguments before the call is sent. So `hook.py` adds
`session_id` to every `get-quota` call, and the server parses it from the raw arguments against a
private allow-list. The model sees a tool with no inputs, and has nothing to fill in or get wrong.
A call from a subagent carries the parent session's ID, which is the session whose status line is
recorded, and the subagent's `agent_id`, by which the server finds the subagent's transcript.

Without the hook, every call fails with an error that names it.
