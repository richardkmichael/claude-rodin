# Summary

A collection of skills, subagents, and hooks for Claude Code. Each component is self-contained and
installed independently.

## Subagents

- `git-wright` — owns all git operations: committing, interactive rebase, staging, conflict
  resolution, branch and remote management, and pull requests.
- `github-researcher` — researches GitHub (issues, pull requests, releases, CHANGELOGs) through
  the `gh` CLI.

## Skills

- `create-commit-message` — write a commit message for the staged changes, matching the project's
  conventions.
- `git-interactive` — reshape git history: interactive rebase, split, squash, reorder, amend,
  `add -p`. Uses the `tmux` skill for the terminal session.
- `history` — search and read past Claude Code session transcripts.
- `learning-quiz` — teach the operator the concepts covered in the session, working a checklist and
  quizzing to confirm each stage before moving on.
- `refine-plan` — interview the user about a plan file to sharpen it.
- `tmux` — drive interactive CLIs (git, python, gdb) by sending keystrokes and scraping pane
  output.
- `tool-usage` — query the `tool-monitor` database to analyze Claude's tool usage.

## Hooks

- `tool-monitor` — captures every tool invocation into a SQLite database via the four
  tool-hook events, for later analysis of tool usage. A Rust binary; pairs with the `tool-usage`
  skill. See `hooks/tool-monitor/README.md` for the schema, example queries, and migration tools.
- `github-researcher` — denies `github.com` and `githubusercontent.com` WebFetch calls in the main
  agent, allowed inside the agent, and logged either way. Pairs with the `github-researcher`
  subagent.

## Installation

### Skills and subagents

Claude Code discovers skills from `~/.claude/skills/` and subagents from `~/.claude/agents/`.

Install a component by symlinking it or copying it:

```
# Skill: symlink the directory (or use `cp -R` to copy)
ln -s "$PWD/skills/tool-usage" ~/.claude/skills/tool-usage

# Subagent: symlink the file (or use `cp` to copy)
ln -s "$PWD/subagents/git-wright.md" ~/.claude/agents/git-wright.md
```

Two skills need another component installed first: `tool-usage` reads the database the
`tool-monitor` hook writes, and `git-interactive` drives its terminal through the `tmux` skill.

### tool-monitor hook

Build and install the binary, then wire the four tool-hook events (`PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`,
`PostToolUseFailure`, `PermissionRequest`) to it in `settings.json`:

```
cargo install --path hooks/tool-monitor --root ~
# installs ~/bin/claude-tool-monitor
```

The database is created on first run. See `hooks/tool-monitor/README.md` for the exact hook
configuration, schema, example queries, and migration tools.

### github-researcher hook

`gate.sh` runs as a `PreToolUse` hook on `WebFetch`; `invocation.sh` runs as a `SubagentStart` hook
matched to the `github-researcher` agent. Place both scripts where Claude Code can run them
(symlink or copy), then wire them in `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "WebFetch",
        "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/hooks/github-researcher/gate.sh"}]
      }
    ],
    "SubagentStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "github-researcher",
        "hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/hooks/github-researcher/invocation.sh"}]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Pair it with the `github-researcher` subagent so denied main-thread fetches have somewhere to route.
